  name: Decimal
  year: 2019
  foundry: H&Co
  role: Typeface Designer, Manufacturing
  team:
    - Design Director: Jonathan Hoefler
    - Senior Designer: Sara Soskolne
    - Team: Andy Clymer, Jordan Bell, Troy Leinster
  description: Decimal was inspired by Jonathan's love of watches, in particular a certain kind of venacular lettering found across a wide range of swiss watchmakers. Andy Clymer worked with Jonathan on an early prototype version, but it was still mostly a sketch when the team from Netflix's Abstract came to Jonathan. He pitched Decimal as a way to show the process of type design to a general audience and Netflix liked the idea. So, we designed Decimal from start to finish within a year and in front of cameras. Sara Soskolne took the lead, working with Jonathan on the shape of the medium, and the rest of us followed close behind. Jordan worked on the Medium Italic, Troy on the Thin and myself on the Ultra.

  name: Exchange & Retina
  year: 2017
  foundry: Frere-Jones Type
  role: Junior Designer
  team:
    - Design Director: Tobias Frere-Jones
    - FJT Team (Exchange): Nina Stössinger, Fred Shallcrass, Tim Ripper, Graham Bradley.
    - FJT Team (Retina): Graham Bradley, Nina Stössinger, Tim Ripper, Dave Foster, Octavio Pardo
    - H&FJ Team (Exchange & Retina): Sara Soskolne, Ksenya Samarskaya, Erin McLaughlin, Aoife Mooney
  description: Typefaces sometimes lead long lives, with many hands to help them along. Exchange and Retina are two such typefaces, in which I played a very small part. The Wall Street Journal commissioned them in 2003 when Tobias was a part of Hoefler & Frere-Jones. In about 2013, there was a renewed interest in releasing them for retail, and they were my first projects as a typeface designer at H&FJ with Tobias. They weren't finished by the time Tobias left the company in 2014, but he was able to take them with him to finish them off at his new company, Frere-Jones Type. There, I imagine pretty much all of my contributions were revised by the great team there, but I appreciate him crediting me and the H&FJ team never the less. Retina is a part of permanent collection at MoMA.

    - Design Director: Jonathan Hoefler
    - Senior Designer: Sara Soskolne
  description: The online retail site Net-A-Porter came to H&Co in about 2013 asking for a thinner version of Chronicle Display for their new magazine, Porter. Jonathan asked me to see how thin I could possibly make the hairlines; the answer was 4 units. This was my first project I worked on from start to finish at H&Co and I learned a lot.

  year: 2016
  foundry: H&Co
  role: Typeface Designer
  team:
    - Design Director: Jonathan Hoefler
    - Senior Designers: Sara Soskolne, Tobias Frere-Jones
    - Team: Andy Clymer, Aoife Mooney, Erin McLaughlin, Luke Joyner
  description: Whitney originated as a typeface for the Whitney Museum in New York City, drawn by Tobias Frere-Jones even before he joined H&FJ. It had a regular width with an italic for text, and a small Condensed family with no italic for display. It was up to the H&Co Team, starting in about 2012, to knit all the pieces together to create a larger Whitney family. The work first too place under the direction of Tobias Frere-Jones, then under Sara Soskolne after Tobias left H&FJ in 2014.

  name: Quarto
  year: 2014
  foundry: H&Co
  role: Junior Designer, Manufacturing
  team:
    - Design Director: Jonathan Hoefler
    - Senior Designers: Sara Soskolne
  description: Quarto started off life as a typeface commissioned by Portfolio magazine, inspired by Henrik van der Keere's Two-line Double Pica Roman. It's always been Sara Sosklne's passion project, and in my opinion it's one of the most beautiful serifs in the H&Co catalog. I helped her at the end with finishing up the character set with her and doing the kerning.
